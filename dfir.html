        <h2>Forensic Science</h2>
        <p>
            Forensic science is the application of scientific methods and techniques to provide evidence in legal cases and possibly solve crimes. Forensic science covers a wide range of disciplines; such as DNA analysis, fingerprint analysis, bloodstain pattern analysis, firearms examination and ballistics, drug chemistry, and more. Forensic scientists collect, preserve, and analyze physical evidence from scenes of crime.
        </p>
        <p>
            The application of forensic science is in both criminal and civil cases, such as rape, murder, drug trafficking, pollution, industrial injuries, and more. Forensic science covers a wide range of disciplines, such as anthropology, biology, chemistry, psychology, geology, digital forensics, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
            Forensic scientists are tasked to collect, preserve, and analyze evidence from scenes of crime. They may also testify as expert witnesses in court.
        </p>
        <p>
            Forensic science is governed by the legal standards of admissible evidence and criminal procedure. The evidence must be relevant, reliable, and obtained in a lawful manner.
        </p>
        <p>
            Forensic science is based on Locard's exchange principle: "whenever two objects come into contact, there is always a transfer of material between them." This helps in linking the suspect to the crime scene or the victim.
        </p>
        <p>
            Forensic science relies on both physical and biological evidence, such as fingerprints, DNA, bloodstains, firearms, drugs, etc. Each type of evidence has its own methods of collection, preservation, and analysis.
        </p>

        <h3>Digital Forensics</h3>
        <p>
            Digital forensics, a branch of forensic science, is used to investigate cybercrimes, malware attacks, data breaches, frauds, and intellectual property thefts. In digital forensics, we deal with recovery, analysis, and preservation of the information found on digital devices such as computers, smartphones, tablets, etc.
        </p>
        <p>Digital forensics has five key steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Identification:</strong> The first step involves identifying the sources and types of digital evidence that can be relevant to the case. For example, in a ransomware attack, the digital evidence may include binary hashes, infected files, ransom notes, encryption keys, and network logs.</li>
            <li><strong>Preservation:</strong> This step involves securing and protecting digital evidence from alteration, damage, or loss. For example, a forensic image of the affected device may be created, storing an exact copy of the data and metadata for analysis.</li>
            <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Digital evidence is examined and interpreted using techniques like file carving, data recovery, hash matching, and timeline analysis. In the case of ransomware, it might involve determining when and how the ransomware was installed, who was responsible, and their motive.</li>
            <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> The findings and data are organized and recorded in a structured manner.</li>
            <li><strong>Presentation:</strong> The final step involves preparing a clear and concise report of the findings, such as summarizing evidence in a forensic report with visual aids like graphs, charts, or screenshots.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Digital forensics is based on several key principles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Principle of originality:</strong> Digital evidence should be obtained from the original source whenever possible and should not be altered.</li>
            <li><strong>Principle of continuity:</strong> Digital evidence must be handled and stored securely to prevent unauthorized access, tampering, or loss.</li>
            <li><strong>Principle of reliability:</strong> Validated methods and tools, widely accepted by the scientific and legal communities, must be used in collecting and analyzing digital evidence.</li>
            <li><strong>Principle of relevance:</strong> Digital evidence should be relevant to the investigation and free from excessive or unnecessary information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Digital forensics is a multidisciplinary field requiring technical skills, legal knowledge, and analytical abilities. Practitioners must adhere to ethical standards and codes of conduct to ensure the credibility of their work. As technology evolves, digital forensics faces new challenges and opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>
            A famous use case of digital forensics is the Sony Pictures hack investigation in 2014. A group of hackers, known as Guardians of Peace (GOP), breached Sony Pictures Entertainment's network and stole confidential data such as emails, scripts, and employee records. They demanded Sony cancel the release of "The Interview," a comedy about a fictional plot against North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The FBI conducted a digital forensics investigation and discovered that the hackers used "Destover" malware to wipe Sony’s data. The FBI traced the attack to North Korea, concluding it was an act of cyberterrorism.

        <h3>Branch of Digital Forensics</h3>
        <p>
            Digital forensics is the branch of forensics that involves the identification, collection, analysis, and reporting of digital evidence from various devices related to cybercrime, fraud, and other illegal activities. It is used to reconstruct past events, support investigations, and provide evidence.
        </p>
        <p>There are several sub-branches of digital forensics, based on the types of devices or data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Computer Forensics:</strong> Investigates computers and storage devices like hard drives and USB drives. It can recover deleted files, browsing history, and digital artifacts that reveal information about the computer user’s activities.</li>
