        <h2>1. Firewalls</h2>
        <p>Firewalls act as barriers between trusted networks and untrusted networks, such as the internet. They monitor and filter incoming and outgoing traffic based on predetermined security rules.</p>

        <h2>2. Antivirus Software</h2>
        <p>Antivirus programs are designed to detect, prevent, and remove malicious software. They regularly scan files, emails, and downloads to identify potential threats.</p>

        <h2>3. Encryption Tools</h2>
        <p>Encryption tools protect data by converting it into a secure format that cannot be read by unauthorized users. Encryption is widely used to secure communication, databases, and files.</p>

        <h2>4. Network Monitoring Tools</h2>
        <p>Tools like Wireshark and Nagios monitor network traffic for suspicious activity, helping identify potential security breaches or performance issues. They are crucial for network administrators.</p>

        <h2>5. Password Managers</h2>
        <p>Password managers store and generate strong, unique passwords for each of your accounts, making it easier to use complex passwords without memorizing them all.</p>
