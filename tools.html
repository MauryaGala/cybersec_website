        <p>
            Cybersecurity tools help organizations protect their systems and data from various cyber threats. Here are some essential tools used in the field:
        </p>

        <h2>Essential Cybersecurity Tools</h2>
        <h3>1. Antivirus Software</h3>
        <p>
            Antivirus software detects, prevents, and removes malicious software from computers and networks.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Firewalls</h3>
        <p>
            Firewalls act as a barrier between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks, controlling incoming and outgoing traffic.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)</h3>
        <p>
            IDS monitors network traffic for suspicious activities and potential threats, alerting administrators to possible breaches.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Encryption Tools</h3>
        <p>
            Encryption tools protect sensitive data by converting it into a code that can only be decrypted with a specific key.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Systems</h3>
        <p>
            SIEM systems collect and analyze security data from across an organization’s IT infrastructure to detect and respond to threats.
