        <h1>Types of Cyber Threats</h1>
        <p>
            Cyber threats are malicious activities designed to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information systems. Understanding these threats is crucial for effective cybersecurity.
        </p>

        <h2>Common Types of Cyber Threats</h2>
        <h3>1. Malware</h3>
        <p>
            Malware, short for malicious software, includes viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, and spyware. It is designed to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to systems.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Phishing</h3>
        <p>
            Phishing attacks involve tricking individuals into divulging sensitive information, such as usernames and passwords, often through fraudulent emails or websites.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks</h3>
        <p>
            DoS attacks aim to overwhelm a system, network, or website, rendering it unavailable to users by flooding it with traffic.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks</h3>
        <p>
            MitM attacks occur when an attacker intercepts and potentially alters communications between two parties without their knowledge.
        </p>

        <h3>5. SQL Injection</h3>
        <p>
            SQL Injection attacks exploit vulnerabilities in a website’s database query handling to execute malicious SQL statements.
