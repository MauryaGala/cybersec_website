        <h1>Types of Cyber Threats</h1>
        <h2>1. Malware</h2>
        <p>Malware is malicious software designed to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to a computer system. Examples include viruses, worms, ransomware, and spyware. It can be spread through email attachments, malicious downloads, or infected websites.</p>

        <h2>2. Phishing</h2>
        <p>Phishing attacks involve tricking users into providing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details by pretending to be a trustworthy entity, often via email. These attacks are common and can lead to identity theft and financial losses.</p>

        <h2>3. Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS)</h2>
        <p>In a Denial of Service attack, attackers overwhelm a target's system, causing it to crash or become unavailable. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks use multiple systems to increase the intensity of the attack.</p>

        <h2>4. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)</h2>
        <p>A Man-in-the-Middle attack occurs when an attacker intercepts communication between two parties, often without them knowing. The attacker can steal or manipulate the data being transmitted.</p>

        <h2>5. SQL Injection</h2>
        <p>SQL injection attacks exploit vulnerabilities in web applications that interact with databases. Attackers can insert malicious SQL statements to gain unauthorized access to data.</p>

        <h2>6. Zero-Day Exploits</h2>
        <p>Zero-day exploits target vulnerabilities in software that are unknown to the software vendor. Because there is no fix or patch available, these attacks can be devastating and go undetected for long periods.</p>
