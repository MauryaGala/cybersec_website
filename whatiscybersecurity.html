            <h2>What is Cybersecurity?</h2>
            <p>
                Cybersecurity refers to the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. It's also known as information technology security or electronic information security. Cybersecurity measures are implemented to combat unauthorized access, attacks, and damage to data and systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cybersecurity is crucial in todayâ€™s world due to the rising dependence on computer systems, the internet, and wireless networks such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. Protecting your information online is paramount, as it impacts individuals, businesses, and governments worldwide.

        <section id="types-of-cyber-threats">
            <h2>Types of Cyber Threats</h2>
            <p>Cybersecurity is constantly evolving to combat a variety of cyber threats. Some of the most common types of cyber threats include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Malware:</strong> Malicious software that includes viruses, worms, and ransomware. Malware infects devices, steals or damages data, and disrupts normal operations.</li>
                <li><strong>Phishing:</strong> Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information by pretending to be a trustworthy entity through email, phone, or other digital communications.</li>
                <li><strong>Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:</strong> This occurs when a third party intercepts communication between two parties, often to steal sensitive information like login credentials or financial data.</li>
                <li><strong>Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks:</strong> These attacks aim to make a system or network unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic or sending information that triggers a crash.</li>
                <li><strong>Ransomware:</strong> A type of malware that locks users out of their systems or encrypts their data and demands payment for access to be restored.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Section: Cybersecurity Tools -->
        <section id="cybersecurity-tools">
            <h2>Essential Cybersecurity Tools</h2>
            <p>To protect against these cyber threats, cybersecurity professionals use various tools to safeguard networks and systems. Some important cybersecurity tools include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Firewalls:</strong> A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.</li>
                <li><strong>Antivirus Software:</strong> Antivirus software detects, prevents, and removes malware and viruses from computers.</li>
                <li><strong>Encryption Tools:</strong> Encryption converts data into a secure format that unauthorized users cannot read. It ensures confidentiality and protects sensitive data.</li>
                <li><strong>Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):</strong> These systems monitor networks for suspicious activity and potential security breaches.</li>
                <li><strong>VPNs (Virtual Private Networks):</strong> VPNs provide a secure connection to another network over the internet, allowing for safe browsing and data protection.</li>
                <li><strong>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):</strong> This security measure adds an extra layer of protection by requiring a second form of verification beyond a password.</li>
            </ul>
