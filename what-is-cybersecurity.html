        <h1>What is Cybersecurity?</h1>
        <p>Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks aim to access, change, or destroy sensitive information, extort money, or disrupt normal business processes. Implementing effective cybersecurity measures is challenging because there are more devices than people, and attackers are becoming more innovative.</p>
        
        <h2>The Importance of Cybersecurity</h2>
        <p>In todayâ€™s hyper-connected world, cybersecurity has become a top priority for individuals, businesses, and governments. Data breaches, ransomware, and other cybercrimes pose significant risks, leading to financial losses, reputational damage, and compromised personal information.</p>
        
        <h2>Key Concepts in Cybersecurity</h2>
        <h3>Confidentiality</h3>
        <p>Ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorized to have access. This includes protecting personal and sensitive information from unauthorized access.</p>

        <h3>Integrity</h3>
        <p>Maintaining the accuracy and completeness of data. Preventing unauthorized alterations or destruction of data is critical to ensure trustworthiness.</p>

        <h3>Availability</h3>
        <p>Ensuring that information and systems are accessible to authorized users when needed. Systems should be protected from disruptions caused by cyberattacks, such as denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.</p>

        <h3>Authentication & Non-repudiation</h3>
        <p>Authentication ensures that users are who they say they are, while non-repudiation ensures that actions taken cannot be denied later.</p>
