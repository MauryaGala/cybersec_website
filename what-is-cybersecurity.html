        <h1>What is Cybersecurity?</h1>
        <p>
            Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These attacks are often aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information, extorting money from users, or disrupting normal business processes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cybersecurity is essential in today’s digital world as it helps to safeguard personal data, intellectual property, and national security. Effective cybersecurity measures ensure that systems are secure from various threats such as malware, phishing, and hacking.

        <h2>Key Concepts in Cybersecurity</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Ensuring that information is only accessible to those who are authorized to view it. This is often achieved through encryption and access controls.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Integrity:</strong> Ensuring that data is accurate and has not been tampered with. Measures to maintain integrity include hashing and checksums.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Availability:</strong> Ensuring that information and resources are available to authorized users when needed. This involves maintaining hardware and software, as well as implementing redundancy and backup solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
            By understanding and implementing these key concepts, organizations and individuals can better protect themselves against potential cyber threats.
